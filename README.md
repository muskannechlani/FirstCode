Kruskal's algorithm  is a greedy algorithm in GRAPH THEORY and  minimum-spanning-tree algorithm.
It finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
My code  includes implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm using  Disjoint Set Union.
      Disjoint Sets is a data structure which partitions a set of items. 
      A partition is a set of sets such that each item is in one and only one set.
